# Equitas: Executive Summary

## What is Equitas?

**Equitas** is an AI-powered civil rights compliance assessment tool that helps companies identify discrimination risks in their software products before they become legal liabilities.

---

## The Problem

Companies building AI systems, hiring tools, lending platforms, and automated decision-making software face unprecedented legal risk:

- **$365M+** in AI discrimination settlements (2020-2024)
- **NYC Local Law 144** now requires bias audits for AI hiring tools
- **EEOC** actively investigating AI-driven employment discrimination
- **CFPB** scrutinizing algorithmic lending decisions
- **Class action lawsuits** targeting proxy discrimination (using zip codes, names, etc.)

Most companies don't have civil rights attorneys reviewing every feature they build. By the time legal reviews happen, the product is already deployed.

## The Solution

Equitas provides **instant compliance risk assessment** during product development:

### How It Works

1. **Describe your feature** - Enter what your product does and what data it uses
2. **Get instant analysis** - AI identifies protected class data, proxy variables, and legal risks
3. **Receive recommendations** - Prioritized fixes with effort estimates and law references
4. **Document compliance** - Export reports for legal review and audit trails

### What It Detects

| Risk Type | Example | Legal Exposure |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Protected Class Data** | Collecting race, age, gender | Title VII, ADEA, ADA |
| **Proxy Variables** | Using zip codes (proxies for race) | Disparate impact liability |
| **Automated Decisions** | No human review of rejections | EEOC enforcement priority |
| **Missing Safeguards** | No appeals process | Regulatory violations |
